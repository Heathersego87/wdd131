  <h2>Content</h2>

<h3>Home Page</h3>
<p>
  The Home page introduces visitors to The Music Mogul and sets the tone for a fun, 
  colorful learning experience. It includes a hero section with a welcoming headline, 
  supporting text, and a call-to-action button that directs users to the lessons page. 
  Below the hero, visitors will find four feature boxes that highlight the main benefits 
  of the program, such as beginner-friendly lessons, AI-enhanced learning tools, progress 
  tracking, and free starter sheet music. The Home page also includes an interactive 
  Practice Tracker where users can log practice time. This tracker updates live using 
  JavaScript and helps new learners stay motivated. The footer contains attribution and 
  site navigation.
</p>

<h3>Beginner Lessons Page</h3>
<p>
  The Beginner Lessons page provides a structured starting point for new piano students. 
  It begins with an introduction that explains the purpose and flow of the lessons, 
  along with a large header image meant to visually engage younger or beginner visitors. 
  The lessons section lists essential foundational skills such as meeting the keyboard, 
  finger numbers, middle C, rhythm basics, and simple melodies. A dynamic filtering feature 
  allows users to show only “easy” lessons using JavaScript array methods. Beneath the 
  lesson list, users can access an interactive tip generator that displays randomized 
  practice suggestions to improve technique and build confidence.
</p>

<h3>Additional Tools & Features (Within Pages)</h3>
<p>
  The site includes multiple interactive components to support different learning styles. 
  The Practice Tracker (located on the Home page) encourages daily engagement by allowing 
  users to add practice minutes or reset their progress. The Lesson Filter (located on the 
  Lessons page) uses an array of lesson objects to display only beginner-level content. 
  The Practice Tip Generator provides quick motivation and helpful reminders using JavaScript 
  randomness to display a new tip each time the user clicks the button. These elements help 
  make the music learning process enjoyable, consistent, and interactive for students of 
  all ages.
